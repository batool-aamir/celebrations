                                Event planning can be complex and stressful, however hiring an event planner means

                            <h6>Why do I need an event planning?</h6>
                            <div>
                                An experienced event planner saves you time and money.We will supply reputable suppliers
                                and vendors,
                                negotiate the best rates, discounts, terms and conditions on your behalf and co-ordinate
                                all aspects
                                of your event. Using an event planner takes away stress and worry, and gives you peace
                                of mind to enjoy
                                your event.
                            </div>

                            <h6>What’s the difference between event design and event planning?</h6>
                            <div>
                                Event design and event planning work hand in hand to deliver a successful event. Event
                                design
                                is about bringing your event to life with appropriate colours, themes, seating, etc,
                                whereas event
                                planning co-ordinates the logistic elements and budget management.

                                Events by CELEBRATIONS offer tailor made events. This means we incorporate both event
                                design and event
                                planning to create that perfect event.
                            </div>

                            <h6>How do you keep budgets on track?</h6>
                            <div>
                                We are meticulous about keeping track of everything we need to spend money on. This is
                                done
                                by constant monitoring and updating spreadsheets, knowing where to prioritise spending
                                and keeping
                                aside a budget to cater for emergency contingencies.
                            </div>

                            <h6>What factors do you consider when selecting a venue?</h6>
                            <div>
                                We consider the size and capacity of venue needed for the number of guests,
                                facilities provided, parking, technical needs and budget constraints. We visit
                                venues to check on the quality of the facilities and liaise with clients, keeping them
                                informed
                                of decisions made.

                            <h6>How early do we need to start planning an event?</h6>
                            <div>
                                Whilst this obviously depends on the size and nature of the event, we’d always advise
                                you to
                                start putting plans in place as early as possible. At certain times of year certain
                                venues
                                may need to be booked well in advance, as too with reputable suppliers and vendors. We
                                advise
                                handing over the reins to an event planner as soon as you’re aware of an event to be
                                planned.
                                This gives us adequate time to factor in back up plans as well as leaving ample time to
                                negotiate, plan and ensure everything’s in place for your big day.
                            </div>

                            <h6>Can you cope with last minute changes of plan or emergency situations?</h6>
                            <div>
                                We have extensive experience in dealing with the unexpected. We build in contingency
                                measures
                                for all our events and are constantly formulating plans to cope with emergency
                                situations.
                                Rest assured your event is always in the most capable hands.

                            <h6>What is your refund and cancellation policy?</h6>
                            <div>
                                <p> We’re aware that sometimes things happen which are outside of your control.
                                    In the event of needing a refund for a cancelled event, do discuss this with your
                                    event planner as early as possible, before extra services and products may have been
                                    ordered.
                                    We will discuss our policies with you before entering into contracts and then liaise
                                    with you
                                    in the unfortunate event of an event being canceled.
